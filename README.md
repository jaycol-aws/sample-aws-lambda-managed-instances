# AWS Lambda Managed Instances (LMI) Examples

This repository contains sample applications demonstrating AWS Lambda Managed Instances (LMI) across various industries and use cases.

## What is Lambda Managed Instances?

AWS Lambda Managed Instances (LMI) runs Lambda functions on longer-lived AWS-managed compute instances while preserving Lambda's programming model and developer experience. LMI is designed for workloads that benefit from:

- Reduced cold starts through persistent execution environments
- Cost-efficient pricing with EC2 instance hours instead of per-millisecond billing
- Right-sized compute with configurable memory-to-vCPU ratios
- High concurrency with multiple invocations per instance
- Minimal operational overhead without container images or cluster management

## Examples by Industry

### Financial Services (FSI)

- **[Retirement Savings Simulator](./examples/fsi/sample-retirement-savings-simulator/)** - Monte Carlo simulation for retirement planning using sustained CPU-intensive parallel processing

### Tools

- **[LMI Pricing Calculator](https://s12d.com/lmi_tco)** - Interactive cost calculator for comparing AWS Lambda Managed Instances pricing
- **[LMI Scheduler](./tools/scheduler/README.md)** - Schedule-driven cost optimization for LMI capacity providers


## Getting Started

Each example includes:

- Complete deployment instructions using AWS SAM
- Architecture diagrams and design patterns
